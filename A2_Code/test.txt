The goal of this assignment is to implement a congestion controlled pipelined Reliable Data Transfer
(RDT) protocol over UDP, which could be used to transfer a text file from one host to another across an
unreliable network. The protocol should be able to handle packet loss, packet reordering, and duplicate
packets. For simplicity, your protocol is unidirectional, i.e., data will flow in one direction (from the
sender to the receiver) and the acknowledgements (ACKs) in the opposite direction. To implement this
protocol, you will write two programs: a sender and a receiver, with the specifications given below. To
test your implementation, we will provide a third program, the network emulator that will emulate an
unreliable network link. 
this is the end of the test
